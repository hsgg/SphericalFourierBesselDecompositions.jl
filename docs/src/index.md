# SuperFaB Documentation

The purpose of this [Julia](https://julialang.org/) module is to provide an
efficient implementation for spherical Fourier-Bessel decomposition of a scalar
field. The details of the algorithm are presented in
[2102.10079](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10079). SuperFaB is implemented in the
package
[SphericalFourierBesselDecompositions.jl](https://github.com/hsgg/SphericalFourierBesselDecompositions.jl).

## Installation

To install *SuperFaB*, start the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) REPL and type
```julia
]add SphericalFourierBesselDecompositions
```

```@meta
# If that doesn't work (there is a mandatory waiting period for the Julia
# General registry), install it directly
# ```julia
# ]add https://github.com/hsgg/SphericalFourierBesselDecompositions.jl.git
# ```
```

These assume the symmetry between N and N.\n\nThe last version is probably not useful except for testing. It takes a fully calculated window mixing matrix to calculate the coupling matrix brute-force.\n\nIf div2Lp1=true then the whole matrix is divided by 2L+1.\n\nIf interchange_NN′=true then calculate the same, but with N and N interchanged, which might be useful for the covariance matrix.\n\nEither version of power_win_mix() will specialize to a separable window function if win is a SeparableArray.\n\nThe basic usage is to multiply the power spectrum Clnn by this matrix, and the assuption is that there is symmetry in the exchange of k_n and k_n′. (Note that this assumed symmetry, however, destroyes the symmetry in the coupling matrix.)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"reference/#SphericalFourierBesselDecompositions.Windows.window_r-Tuple{SphericalFourierBesselDecompositions.Windows.ConfigurationSpaceModes}","page":"Reference","title":"SphericalFourierBesselDecompositions.Windows.window_r","text":"window_r(wmodes::ConfigurationSpaceModes)\n\nGet the r-values of the radial bins and corresponding widths Delta r, e.g.,\n\nr, Δr = SFB.window_r(wmodes)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"reference/#SFB.WindowChains","page":"Reference","title":"SFB.WindowChains","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"reference/","page":"Reference","title":"Reference","text":"Modules = [SphericalFourierBesselDecompositions.WindowChains]","category":"page"},{"location":"reference/#SphericalFourierBesselDecompositions.WindowChains","page":"Reference","title":"SphericalFourierBesselDecompositions.WindowChains","text":"WindowChains\n\nThis module exposes several ways to calculate a chain of window functions.

It behave similarly to a threaded broadcast, except that it tries to batch iterations such that each batch takes about 0.5 seconds to perform.\n\nThe idea is to automatically adjust the number of iterations per batch so that overhead per iteration is low and batch size is small so that the threads keep getting scheduled.\n\nFor example, imagine that the execution time per iteration increases. With a static scheduler, this would mean that the first threads finish long before the last thread. This avoids that by adjusting the number of iterations so that each batch should take approximately 0.5 seconds.\n\nSo why batch iterations? Imagine you need to allocate a buffer for each iteration, and this buffer can be shared for sequentially run iterations. Allocating a separate buffer would add a lot of overhead, so that traditional map() can take longer than the serial implementation.
